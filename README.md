# This project is under development

## Purpose

At some point of time you have a lot of information on your PC and hard drive space is about to end.

What will you do in this case?
Probably first action is to buy new HDD/SSD/etc.

It is good choise but if you want to see stored information on other device(for example watch film or play game)

there is a problem because you need either to clone information between devices or use remote desktop software(vns/teamviewer/remote desktop)

There are few apps that could help to share information:
1. RaiDrive
    - Pros: it is free, localized, easy to use
    - Cons: it fully downloads file locally before using it(which is bad for gaming and you need to wait till downlaoding finishes before using)
2. Mountain Duck
    - Pros: it supports all popular OS
    - Cons: the same as in RaiDrive
3. ExpanDrive
    - all the same as previous options

## Project goals

If you ask me to subscribe all goals in one word, it will be **Reactivity**.

Under Reactivity I understand performance as close as possible to real HDD(speed is limited only by ethernet connection).

Goals:
1. Store information locally only if needed, without downloading whole file
    - only requested parts of data could be cached
2. Minimise time between clicking an app and its launch
3. Use remote files as any other file on your drive
    - you will see just new drive that is attached to your computer
4. Multitasking - you can operate by different files in parallel
    - like on any other drive
